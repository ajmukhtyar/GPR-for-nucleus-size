# GPR-for-nucleus-size
Method to find correlations between variables like potential energy, volume, density to nucleus size for MD simulation data

Commands:
1. python sort_comment.py --> Generates data_normalized.txt file which is used as input for the GPR model
2. python GPR_comment.py

Data from 200 simulations is stored in output and totord files
